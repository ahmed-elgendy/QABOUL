  Kadir Has University was founded in 1997 in Istanbul, on the European side, by the late engineer, Mr. Abdul Kadir, who dedicated his life to science. He was known for his love of science and his willingness to provide educational assistance at all times. Kadir Has University, specifically, is one of the top 100 Turkish universities and one of the top 3000 universities in the world. Kadir Has University is among the universities recognized in the European Union and a number of Arab countries, at the head of these countries: Iraq and the Arab Republic of Egypt.
  The university has a distinguished campus that combines originality and modernity, dating back to the era of the Ottoman Empire in 1884 and was recently renovated to become a university campus equipped with the latest technology. The campus includes about 7 colleges, including the College of Engineering and Natural Sciences, the College of Economics, Management and Social Sciences, the College of Mass Communication, and the College of Art and Design, in addition to the presence of many vocational schools and graduate schools.
  The student at Kadir Has University receives a brochure that explains everything he wants to know about the university and its educational policy.
  Among the most important sayings of the late engineer, Mr. Abdul Qadir, the founder of the university: “We will strive to do what is best for our country, and hence the goal of Kadir Has University is to facilitate education for today’s youth and remove the obstacles in front of them. In addition to teaching in an academic way that encourages students to think, practice democracy and express opinion. We believe that it is not possible to immunize our youth to meet the requirements of the times without education, as did previous generations that etched an unforgettable history.”
  Kadir Has University aims to create an environment of education, research and discussion at the level of the best universities in the world, where the university teaches various disciplines in a modern and developed manner on the basis of innovation and excellence. The university seeks to train graduates who can objectively address problems and produce appropriate solutions.
