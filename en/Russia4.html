          Address : Leninski Prospect 65, Moscow, Russia. <br> 
          The National University of Oil and Gas «Gubkin University» is a university in Moscow. The university was founded on 17 April 1930 and is named after the geologist Ivan Gubkin. The university is affectionally known as Kerosinka, meaning "kerosene stove".
          During the Soviet period, the university, along with the Moscow State University of Railway Engineering, was known for admitting students of Jewish origin while other universities unofficially barred Jewish students.
          Affiliates of the Gubkin institute exist in Orenburg, Ashgabat, Turkmenistan and Tashkent, Uzbekistan.

  Gubkin history

 

There was a task in the USSR – to prepare 435,000 engineers and technicians in 5 years (1930-1935) during the USSR industrialization period, while their number in 1929 was 66,000.

In 1930 the Moscow Mining Academy was divided into six independent institutes by the order of Supreme Soviet of the National Economy. The Petroleum Engineering Department of the Moscow Mining Academy became the base for the new Moscow Petroleum Institute. The Institute was named in honor of Academician Ivan Gubkin, “who contributed greatly to the foundation of higher education aimed at (of training engineers, needed urgently for the socialist industry”. At this time the young Soviet state was in want of fuel and energy for industrial development. The petroleum industry faced new challenges such as the development of new fields, application of advanced methods of operation, introduction of new production technologies, further development of oil refining technologies and construction of new plants, electrification of the oil industry, as well as the planning, organization and improving the safety of petroleum production.

 

None of these problems could be solved without significant increase in the number of petroleum engineers and Gubkin Institute became the main base for preparing such specialists.

 

At the beginning there were only three faculties at the University, namely: Geology and Oil Exploration, Petroleum Engineering and Refining.

 

The first Rector of the University and the founders of its educational and research schools were Ivan M. Gubkin himself and many famous founders of the Russian (USSR) oil and gas science such as: A.P. Krylov, Yu.A. Kosygin, L.S. Leibenzon, S.S. Nametkin, A.V. Topchiev, I.I. Chernyaev. M.I. Varentsov, N.L. Buslenko, M.A. Kapelyushnikov, M.F. Mirchink, N.S. Nametkin, L.V. Pustovalov, K.A. Chepikov, S.F. Fedorov, G.F. Mirchink, Ya.M. Paushkin; V.I. Isagulyants, L.Sh. Davitashvili; and many others.

 

Nowadays there are more than ten teaching faculties at Gubkin preparing specialists in almost every field of the petroleum industry: from petroleum geology and engineering to energy economics and trading. Since the University's establishment more than 85,000 students have been graduated from Gubkin.

 

The University is justifiably proud of its alumni working in all leading oil and gas Russian and international companies.
